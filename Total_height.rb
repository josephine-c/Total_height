# Using IRB, and using google to get your info, assign the value of the eiffel tower, big ben and taj mahal to the three variables:
# -> eiffel_tower (324m)
# -> big_ben (96m)
# -> taj_mahal (73m)
# Using these variables,  calculate the height of all 3 landmarks added together, and store it in a variable called 'total_height'

big_ben = 96
taj_mahal = 73

p total_height = eiffel_tower + big_ben + taj_mahal
